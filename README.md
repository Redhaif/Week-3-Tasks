# Week-3-Tasks
IOT Week 3 tasks <br />

LINK FOR THE WEBSITE: https://first-firebase-project-3e7af.web.app/

This is the README file for week 3 tasks which is creating an arm control movement panel using html. <br />
You will find in the folder: <br /> 
1- A public folder that contains the html files. <br /> <br />
2- A video folder that contains a video that shows the database is working using Firebase. <br />

I could not find a way to share the databse, so you can see the data changes while navigating in the website. <br />
If there is a way that I could share the database please do tell me. <br />

Thanks for reading. <br />
